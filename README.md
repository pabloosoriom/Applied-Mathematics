# Applied-Mathematics

This repository, named Applied Mathematics, is a collaborative project between myself and my colleague, Pablo Osorio. Our aim is to document our MSc Applied Mathematics journey at Universidad EAFIT. The repository serves as a centralized hub for our research, coursework, and other related materials.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose. Here's an overview of the main directories:

1. **Research**: This directory contains subdirectories dedicated to our research projects. Each subdirectory represents a specific project and includes relevant documentation, code, datasets, and any other materials associated with the project.

2. **Coursework**: Here, we store our coursework-related materials. This includes lecture notes, assignments, solutions, and any additional resources that help us understand the concepts covered in our Applied Mathematics courses.

3. **Presentations**: In this directory, we keep the slides and supporting materials for the presentations we deliver during seminars, conferences, or other academic events.

4. **Code**: This directory holds code snippets, scripts, and programs that are not specific to any particular project but are relevant to our Applied Mathematics studies. We can also include reusable code components or libraries that we develop during the course of our research.

5. **Documentation**: This directory contains general documentation related to our Applied Mathematics studies. It may include references, guides, summaries of mathematical concepts, and other resources that help us deepen our understanding.

## Collaboration Guidelines

To ensure efficient collaboration, we will follow these guidelines:

1. **Branching Model**: We will adopt a branching model where each project or task is developed in a separate branch. When the work is ready, we will create pull requests and review each other's code before merging it into the main branch.

2. **Documentation**: We strive to maintain well-documented code and research materials. Each project directory should include a README file describing the project's purpose, methodology, and any specific instructions on running the code or reproducing the results.

3. **Code Style**: We will adhere to a consistent code style throughout the repository. This includes using meaningful variable and function names, writing clear and concise comments, and following established coding conventions in the languages we use.

4. **Issue Tracking**: We will use GitHub's issue tracking system to manage tasks, bug reports, and feature requests. We will create issues for any new task or bug we encounter, assign them to the appropriate collaborator, and keep track of their progress.

5. **Communication**: We will maintain regular communication through various channels, such as GitHub discussions, instant messaging platforms, and regular meetings. Prompt responses and active participation are encouraged to ensure smooth collaboration.
